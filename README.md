# ABOUT THIS APP
This is a simple React app that calls the back-end using http POST calls and receives a SSE stream of AI tokens from the back-end. The tokens are displayed in the chat in real-time. The back-end interacts with an AI model to detect the mood of the received chat input from the user.
